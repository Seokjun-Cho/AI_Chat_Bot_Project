System Requirements/Setting
- My Operating System = Windows 10
- Python 3.9.5
- Need To Install: Tensorflow, Numpy, Nltk (install these through the command prompt)

How to run the program:
1. Set up your environment with the files
2. Open the termina/command prompt
3. Type "python train.py" to run the program.

What I Learned:
- How AI Chatbot models function (How the Chatbot model classifies the user input and outputs a corresponding response)
- Tokenizing & Stemming sentences
- Necessary installs/downloads such as tensorflow, numpy, nltk, etc to run an AI chat bot model
- How training data is important as the chat bot model can only learn from the given data, meaning that it would give inaccurate responses when the user inputs something that is not included in the training data.

Possible Future Work:
- Improved AI Chat Bot model that can respond accurately to a diverse amount of user inputs.
- Utilizing AI Chat Bot models into other projects (informational chat bots in store websites, chat bots for just talking, etc) as AI is a tool gaining massive popularity in thr world.
